SCIFIIINC KRYPTER is a next-gen cryptographic engine combining time-based OTPs with AES-256-GCM for ultra-secure, post-quantum-resistant encryption. Using SHA-512 cascades and PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 for entropy and key expansion, it delivers millisecond-fast, end-to-end encryption with strong forward secrecy.
