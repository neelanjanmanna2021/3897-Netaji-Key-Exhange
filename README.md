3897-SCIFIIINC-Key-Exhange
SCIFIIINC KRYPTER is a next-gen cryptographic engine combining time-based OTPs with AES-256-GCM for ultra-secure, post-quantum-resistant encryption. Using SHA-512 cascades and PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 for entropy and key expansion, it delivers millisecond-fast, end-to-end encryption with strong forward secrecy.
Applications
Secure offline file exchange
Quantum-resistant credential vaults
Government or military communication systems
One-time key generators for hybrid encryption stacks
Time-limited software licensing and DRM mechanisms
Post-Quantum Suitability
While AES-256 remains strong under classical attacks, quantum computing introduces quadratic speedups in key searches. SCIFIIINC KRYPTER mitigates this through:
Increased key length (256 bits)
SHA-512 based time-synchronized entropy, reducing effective quantum predictability
Dynamic key rotation every time-window, ensuring quantum advantage is minimized before completion of any search
Thus, the system maintains an effective post-quantum security margin exceeding 128 bits, consistent with NIST’s PQC design standards.

Security Properties
Property	Mechanism	Description
Post-Quantum Resistance	SHA-512 & PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512	No efficient quantum shortcut beyond Grover’s O(2^128) complexity.
Forward Secrecy	Time-windowed OTP	Each OTP expires after its window, preventing replay or long-term reuse.
Authenticated Encryption	AES-GCM	Detects tampering using built-in authentication tags.
Password Hardening	PBKDF2 (200 k iterations)	Increases brute-force cost exponentially.
Entropy Injection	File content or sentence input	Strengthens seed randomness using user-defined payloads.
